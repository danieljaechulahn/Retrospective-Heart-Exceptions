This is the repository for all analyses performed for the study entitled "High Rate of Transplantation Prior to Review of Status Exception Requests among Adult Heart Transplant Candidates", 
in which we show that more than 25% of all candidates who have submitted applications for status exceptions from October 18th, 2018 to December 31, 2023 obtained heart transplants before the 
applications were even received by the regional review boards. There is only one file within this repository entitled "retrospective_exceptions.RMD". To run the code, the 2024 Q1 SAF, heart status justification files, and heart match run data are needed from the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients. 

Note: The crux of this paper relies on the fact that the status justification files have a variable called "FormReceiptDt," which describes the date at which the regional review boards submitted a status justification file. By subtracting the "FormEffectiveDt," which is when a form was submitted by a transplant center and active from the "FormReceiptDt," we can determine how long it took for every status justification file to be received by the regional review boards. The data do not have a variable indicating when a status justification file was actually reviewed and voted upon by the boards.
