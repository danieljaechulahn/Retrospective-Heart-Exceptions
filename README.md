This is the repository for all analyses performed for the study entitled "High Rate of Transplantation Prior to Review of Status Exception Requests among Adult Heart Transplant Candidates", 
in which we show that more than 25% of all candidates who have submitted applications for status exceptions from October 18th, 2018 to December 31, 2023 obtained heart transplants before the 
applications were even received by the regional review boards. There is only one file within this repository entitled "retrospective_exceptions.RMD". To run the code, the 2024 Q1 SAF and status 
justification files are needed from the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients.
